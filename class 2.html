<h3>Read an Bhagat Singh</h3>
<h5>Chapter 1:The Beginning</h5>
<p>Bhagat Singh was a hero of the early 20th-century Indian independence movement. 
He was a vocal critic of British rule in India and was involved in two high-profile attacks on British authorities—
one on a local police chief and the other on the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. He was executed for his crimes in 1931 at the age of 23.</p>
<p  ><small>Bhagat Singh was involved in two high-profile plots against British authorities in India that helped galvanize the Indian independence
 movement. In 1928 he took part in a plot to kill the police chief responsible for the death of influential Indian writer and politician Lala Lajpat Rai.
 However, he and a coconspirator mistakenly killed the assistant superintendent of police, J.P. Saunders, and Singh fled the city of Lahore 
(now in Pakistan) to escape execution. In 1929, protesting against the Defence of India Act, he and an accomplice threw a bomb at the 
Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi before surrendering. While in jail, Singh helped organize a hunger strike to protest against prisoner 
mistreatment, a demonstration that gained him wide support in India. Nevertheless, he was hanged in 1931 for Saunders’s murder.</small></p>
